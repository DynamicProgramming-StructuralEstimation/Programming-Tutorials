    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like many other programming languages out there, Python's functionality builds on so-called `programming paradigms`. While some languages may require you to use a certain paradigm, others allow for more than one paradigm in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is mostly referred to as an `object-oriented` programming language, implying that only `Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)` - one of many paradigms - is allowed in it. However, the language supports and encourages the use of other paradigms too. Users can mix and match the paradigms in a way that suits the problem at hand and matches their programming style. This feature grants the user a lot of flexibility and is probably one reason why Python has become so popular. It would, therefore, be more accurate to speak of Python as a multi-paradigm programming language instead of a purely object-oriented one.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections, we will first provide you with a brief overview of the main paradigms in Python. Then, by building Tesla's Model X step by step, we will be illustrating the differences between the paradigms and show that each of them would do the trick.    \n",

    "## Overview of Programming Paradigms \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, what exactly are programming paradigms? Roughly speaking, a paradigm is a way of solving a problem. Each paradigm offers a different set of ideas to perform the task at hand. They follow a paradigm-specific approach, structure your code and control its execution.     \n",
    "\n",
    "The three main paradigms that are supported by Python are:  \n",
    "1. [Procedural](###Procedural)  \n",
    "2. [Functional](#functional_comparison)  \n",
    "3. [Object-Oriented](#oop_comparison)\n",
    "\n",
    "They differ mainly in when and how the program assigns values to variables. Controlling this is important because it directly affects the manageability and reliability of the code. Chaotic, repetitive or copy-paste codes are more prone to mistakes, difficult to read and hard to maintain. Programming paradigms assist you in writing well-structured code so that it remains comprehensible and concise.\n"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Procedural\n",
    "\n",
    "The `procedural` paradigm might be the most intuitive of the three. It uses a top-down approach, where it breaks the problem down into small pieces and instructs the machine step by step how to solve a task. The state of a variable is changed directly along the way, which makes the code very easy to follow and understand. For the machine it is like following a recipe. \n",
    "  \n",
    "However, the longer and more complex a code, the more difficult it gets to stay on top of things. For example, a programmer would always have to know which variable names he already used because accidentally assigning a value to an existing variable may cause problems down the line. Finally, reusing a program that follows the procedural paradigm is often not that easy and requires you to code up every step again.\n"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Functional\n",
    "\n",
    "While the procedural paradigm follows a step by step approach, the `functional` paradigm solves a task by executing a series of functions. In this case, the state of a variable is changed by applying a function to it. The definition of the function happens strictly seperate from its use and is done in a general way, such that we can use it again with different inputs. This procedure might be a little more time consuming at first, but it has the advantage that later on, we can use the function for similar tasks without having to code every instruction again. \n",
    "\n",
    "This reusability makes the code a lot shorter. However, one will have to look up the function definition to understand what it does and how it changes the state of the variable. Additionally, when working with imported functions there is always the possibility of unwanted changes to their functionality. If the package creators decide to change said function, this will affect your program too.\n",

    "### Object Oriented\n",
    "\n",
    "The `object-oriented` programming paradigm is built on the notion of classes and objects. These objects are similar to real life objects and all objects of the same class share certain attributes (states) or methods (functionalities). However, each object can also have personal attributes, just like one jacket might be red and the other one might be green, they both have the ability to keep you warm though.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you see, with OOP state and function are no longer separated but happen both within the object. The problem at hand is then solved through the interaction between the different objects. For example, if you, as a human object, are cold you could put on the jacket object to solve that problem. The fact, that OOP basically mimicks the real world, makes it easier to understand and since these objects are whole in themselves, they can easily be used in different applications. \n",

    "## Example Case: Building a Car\n",
    "In the following sub-chapters, the three different paradigms - procedural, functional and object oriented - will all be illustrated by the same example: the construction of the Model X car by the manufacturer Tesla. The aim of this chapter is to convey to the reader that the three paradigms are not completely different 'things', but rather allow a different perspective or approach to tackle one and the same problem. The example with the car, a simple everyday objcet, is used to convey the concepts of the three paradigms more easily. To get a better idea of the car, here is a picture of the original Model X by Tesla:\n",
