    "## Introduction\n",
    "Programming languages are often classified by the programming paradigm they mainly support. The features of each programming language often encourage, or even mandate, structuring the various parts of a program in a specific way. While Python is often referred to as an object-oriented language, it is probably best described as a multi-paradigm programming language as its features also support many other programming paradigms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between the various paradigms is the way they handle the state of the program, i.e. the values of its variables. Controlling how and where state is transformed in a program has practical implications for how reliable and manageable the code becomes. Each programming pradigm offers a different way of managing state, in the hope that the program does not quickly fall into the trap of \"spaghetti code\", where the code is so badly structured that it becomes too complex to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, three programming paradigms are: \n",
    "1. [Procedural](###Procedural)\n",
    "2. [Functional](#functional_comparison)\n",
    "3. [Object-Oriented](#oop_comparison)\n",
    "\n",
    "The following subsections will illustrate the differences between these three programming paradigms by producing the same output using code organised in these three different ways."
